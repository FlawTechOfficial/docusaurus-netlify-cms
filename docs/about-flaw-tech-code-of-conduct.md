title: Code of Conduct
---

All participants of Flaw Tech are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct, both online and during in-person events that are hosted and/or associated with Flaw Tech.

## The Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## The Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Referring to people by their preferred pronouns and using gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Not being respectful to reasonable communication boundaries, such as 'leave me alone,' 'go away,' or 'I’m not discussing this with you.'
- The usage of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Demonstrating the graphics or any other content you know may be considered disturbing
- Starting and/or participating in arguments related to politics
- Assuming or promoting any kind of inequality including but not limited to: age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, nationality and race, personal appearance, religion, or sexual identity and orientation
- Drug promotion of any kind
- Attacking personal tastes
- Other conduct which you know could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## How our staff enforces the above
1. We respect the Community Guidelines in our interactions with members and expect members to do the same when interacting with staff.
2. We rely on reports via flagged posts to take action and to discuss situations with members.
3. We approach any enforcement of the Rules and Code of Conduct primarily through private discussion. Any action we take will be prompted by or to support discussion. Any enforcement action by community staff taken is open for discussion with that member of staff.
4. We will respond to private messages and e-mails as soon as we're able (usually within a working day or two and rarely more than a week) but due to the volume and different types of messages we get, we can't always guarantee that we'll get back to every message or e-mail we receive. We prioritize conversations around education and questions from members but if you haven't heard from us and you were expecting a response, please don't hesitate to let the person in question know. 
5. We believe in treating people like adults. This means that we talk and ensure both sides understand the situation fully and that people accept responsibility for their own actions and the consequences those actions have on others.
6. We expect members who are contacted by staff to listen to the feedback and to treat any advice given with the same importance as the Rules and Code of Conduct.
7. We look to improve conversation and will take the action that is most likely to lead to that result.
8. Though we have tried to make the Rules as unambiguous as possible and the Rules apply to all members equally, we treat people and situations individually. History of previous behavior, the context of the conversation, the people involved and their relationships to one another are all factors that we can and will consider.
9. Any breach of these guidelines may result in the editing or removal of posts/threads, or may result in a suspension from the community altogether and may have a negative effect on your payback.
10. We can suspend (“ban”) a member from the community if:
 - They are clearly acting in a way contrary to the Community Guidelines and/or breaking the rules.
 - If conversations about behavior that goes against the Community Guidelines have not yielded a positive change in that behavior.
 - If they have blocked communication or are completely unresponsive to discussion Suspensions can be either time-based, indefinite, or permanent:
 - Time-based: these suspensions are intended to correct behavior and give members some time away from the community to reflect. The time is dependent on the situation and the ensuing conversation with the member. This can range from a few hours to weeks.
 - Indefinite: the member is suspended without an agreed-upon time of return. This happens when we need to discuss a situation and the person’s response will dictate the length of the suspension. We look to resolve these rapidly by lifting the suspension, setting a time-frame, or making the suspension permanent. In cases where a decision cannot be made with the member, we will declare the discussion “deadlocked” and we will refer the member to escalate the situation further to get a resolution.
 - Permanent: the member is suspended with the expectation that they will not be granted access again. Permanent suspensions are imposed for very serious breaking of the Rules or for repeated offenses where temporary suspensions have not prompted a change in behavior.

 In the majority of cases, suspension from the forums will not affect the use of Flaw Tech mobile services, nor will it stop payback being earned for recruitment. We reserve the right to restrict the use of such services in extreme cases.

 Previous suspensions (temporary, indefinite, or permanent) may be overturned at the discretion of Flaw Tech.

 Suspended members will continue to have access to read the community and knowledge base as well as the ability to raise cases with the staff.

## Disputes
In the event of disputes or clarification on any of the guidelines, the Community Management Team has the final say. We will not discuss individual details of any of our moderation decisions on the public forums.

The process for disputes is as follows:
- Discuss the situation/issue directly with the staff member who took the action. This is likely through a Private Message on the community or in the case of suspension through the community e-mail address (we will also reach out to the person in question via e-mail to initiate this contact).
- If you wish to escalate further any discussion or dispute you may have with a decision or a member of our Community Team, please request that they refer you to an administrator or contact another member of the community team.

Violations of the Code of Conduct may also be reported by sending an email to support@flaw.tech. All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

We hold the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any members for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

**Updating the guidelines:** Please note these guidelines are subject to updates without notice.

For any major changes, we will announce them in the [blog](https://dev.flaw.tech/blog) section. We urge you to check these guidelines on a regular basis.
