When referring to Flaw Tech trademarks and the names of Flaw Tech software, products, and services, follow these Flaw Tech Trademark and Brand Guidelines.

You may use Flaw Tech trademarks in text solely to refer to and/or link to Flaw Tech's products and services and in accordance with the terms of these Guidelines.

**You may not:**

- use Flaw Tech logos, logotypes, icons, trade dress or other elements of Flaw Tech packaging, websites or materials unless specifically permitted under these Guidelines or other applicable guidelines;
- use the trademarks in the name of your business, product, service, app, domain name, social media account, or other offering (with the exception of seminars and conferences, which are covered by the Publications, Seminars, and Conferences Guidelines;
- use the trademarks more prominently than your product or service name;
- use the trademarks on promotional merchandise that you are selling or distributing (such as t-shirts, travel mugs, etc.);
- do or say anything or use the trademarks in a way that implies affiliation with, or sponsorship, endorsement or approval by Flaw Tech of your products or services;
- alter, animate, or distort the trademarks or combine them with any other symbols, words, images or designs, or incorporate them into a tagline or slogan;
- use the trademarks in any way that is contrary to these Guidelines and/or the Publications, Seminars, and Conferences Guidelines.

## App Guidelines
Your registered publisher name and everything about your app—name, logo, description, screenshots—must be unique and free of Flaw Tech trademarks unless (1) you’ve secured permission from Flaw Tech through a license or equivalent (though such licenses are not generally available in this context); or (2) you’re only using a Flaw Tech trademark (not including logos) to describe that your product is designed to work in conjunction with a Flaw Tech product or service and as long as your app logo and/or name:

- does not suggest/give the impression your app is actually published by, affiliated with or endorsed by Flaw Tech; and
- denotes your own unique brand so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation or endorsement by Flaw Tech.

In addition, Flaw Tech logos cannot be used as a source identifier for your app icon.

## Social Media Guidelines
The name of your social media account, any and all pages or communities, cannot begin with a Flaw Tech trademark. In addition, Flaw Tech logos cannot be used in a way that might suggest affiliation with Flaw Tech, including, but not limited to, the account, profile, or header images. The only exceptions to these requirements are if (1) you’ve secured permission from Flaw Tech through a license or equivalent (though such licenses are not generally available in this context); or (2) you’re using a Flaw Tech trademark (not including logos) to describe the purpose of your account, page, or community provided that:

- you are not suggesting affiliation with or endorsement by Flaw Tech; and,
- your account does not use the name or likeness of any prominent individuals within Flaw Tech.

However, it would be acceptable to name your account, page, or community "Information about Flaw Tech Products" as long as you do not use the Flaw Tech logos or otherwise suggest any affiliation with Flaw Tech.

## For More Information
If your proposed use falls outside of these Guidelines or the Brand specific guidelines linked to above, the use is not permitted unless you seek approval from an appropriate contact within Flaw Tech.
