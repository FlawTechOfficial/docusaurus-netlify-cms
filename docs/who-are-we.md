Before Flaw Tech, we operated under different alias 'Hack Hex' in 2018 to 2020. As our traffic grew, we quickly realised the need for community based website where everyone can contribute and help others in the process. Our goal has been the same from day one, to educate people.

Flaw Tech operates under the company "Flaw Tech Development". We are continuously working in the direction to better the platform and would love to hear your valuable thoughts and feedback to make it more resourceful.
